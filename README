Readme

RetroBlog is a static site generator built with <a href="https://deno.land/manual.html#introduction">Deno</a>. I coded up this static site generator in Deno for practice, for fun and to learn. And if you can get some good from it, great.

Please note: This is a work in progress. Pull requests invited. Right now everything is in json and I'd like to get a markdown parser going as soon as possible.

Howto
-----
1. After you do the build step use <a href="https://deno.land/manual.html#fileserver">Deno FileServer</a> to serve your build folder, which will be at localhost:4500.
2. (For best results, invoke %file_server inside the build folder.)
