He created it and now lots of us are working on things connected to it. I wanted a static site generator built in Deno, and since a few searches on startpage indicated that no one had yet made one, I figured I would. There are still loads of things needed: a markdown parser for starters. But I have a few part-time things happening, so when I'm not doing that, I'm doing yoga. Or coding. Or walking around the neighborhood, witnessing Spring."
